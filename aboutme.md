### Research Interests
- Causal Machine Learning
  - Causal effect estimation across diverse time settings and data types, particularly in scenarios where assuming identical treatment effects across units is challenging. My research encompasses both model-agnostic and model-specific approaches, aiming to enhance the understanding of intervention impacts in complex settings.

- Causal Data Synthesis
  - Counterfactual inference across various data types and problem settings, including counterfactual explanations, counterfactual image editing, EHR synthesis. I apply these techniques to high-dimensional, multimodal data to address real-world problems in safety-critical domains. This approach leverages SCMs, their variants, and latent causal modeling when necessary, ensuring a robust and comprehensive approach to complex challenges in practical applications.

- Watching videos on Disney+ (e.g., Marvel Studios' animated series "What if...?")
